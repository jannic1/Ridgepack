% Ridgepack_RASM_sea_ice_extent_volume_script - summary graph of RASM results
%
% This script prepares an analysis plot of RASM sea ice output equivalent
% to the example ridgepack_example_seaice_volume_graph_1980_2010_0.png.
% The script uses a wide array of observational and model data to construct the plot:
%
% 1) ICESat data from JPL
% 2) PIOMAS data from University of Washington
% 3) Ice area and extent from NSIDC NOAA CDR
% 4) RASM ice area (aice), thickness (hi) and snow depth (hs)
%
% The RASM data is assumed to be in the form of a single file for each 
% variable, organized as a timeseries using the 'rasm_cice5_series.bash'
% script on the chosen supercomputer used to integrate RASM. That script
% is located under the bash directory of the RASM Sea Ice Toolbox
% in Ridgepack. This produces files with a filename, for e.g. 'hi', as
% c6G05b.cice.h.hi.nc for the simulation 'c6G05b'.
